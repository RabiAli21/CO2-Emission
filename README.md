# CO2 Emission Prediction Project

# Overview

 This project focuses on analyzing and predicting CO2 emissions using machine learning techniques. The goal is to provide insights into CO2 emission patterns and build a predictive model for forecasting emissions based on provided data.

# Features

   Data Analysis: Explore CO2 emission trends and identify key contributing factors.

   Machine Learning Model: Train a Random Forest model to predict CO2 emissions.

   Web Application: Deploy the predictive model for user-friendly interaction.
